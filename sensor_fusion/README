To execute:
1. Add the .ulg logs to the ulogs_mission folder.
2. Run in the command console, at the same directory as the methodology.py file is, this command:
    <python directory> methodology.py <args*>
        * select if you want to discard any data category for the innovation calculation :
        --velocity      as -v
        --position      as -p
        --magnetometer  as -m
        * We can also select the format of the output figures (graphs, boxplots and histograms).
        --figures_format as -ff (default: -ff .svg)
        * If you want the graphs to show the data of each flight superimposed, this way you can better observe differences for the same time instant.
        --superposition as -s (default: -s False)
        * enter the value in minutes of separation between one flight and another, to use it superposition must mut be desactivate
        --padding as -pd (default: -pd 1)
    ex: <python directory> methodology.py -m -ff .png -pd 1
3.  After the execution, an output folder named "outputs" will be generated with all the relevant information.
